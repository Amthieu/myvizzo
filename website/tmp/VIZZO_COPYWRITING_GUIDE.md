## Vizzo Knowledge Base & Copywriting Brief

### Document Purpose

This document serves as the authoritative source of truth for creating website copy for myvizzo.com. Any AI agent or copywriter working on this project must internalize this information before generating any content. The goal is strategic, conversion-focused copy that feels human, premium, and trustworthy—not like typical AI-generated marketing content.

## Part 1: Product & Business Understanding

### 1.1 What Vizzo Is

**The One-Sentence Explanation:**
Vizzo is a premium countertop device that displays a business's live Google rating and encourages satisfied customers to share their experience, paired with a SaaS dashboard that provides review analytics and AI-powered response tools.

**The Expanded Explanation:**
Vizzo solves a fundamental problem for local businesses: most satisfied customers never leave reviews. Not because they didn't enjoy the experience, but because nothing prompts them to act. By the time they leave, the moment has passed.

The device creates a passive, elegant reminder at the point of maximum satisfaction—when a customer has just had a great meal, a perfect haircut, or a successful repair. It accomplishes two things:

1. **Prompts action from satisfied customers:** A visible rating with thoughtfully crafted copy creates a gentle psychological nudge. The customer thinks: "That was great. I should add my review to this." The device doesn't beg or interrupt—it simply makes leaving a review feel like a natural next step.

2. **Builds trust with new customers:** For customers who are already in the store but still evaluating (especially for high-consideration services like auto repair or dental), seeing a live 4.8-star rating with hundreds of reviews provides immediate reassurance.

The hardware is intentionally designed to be beautiful and functional. It's not just a screen on a wall—Vizzo will offer multiple form factors designed to integrate naturally into different business environments. Some will sit on counters. Some will serve functional purposes beyond display. The specific form factors are part of what makes Vizzo different, and we'll reveal them strategically. For now, the message is: these devices belong in your space, not bolted onto it.

**The AI Search Revolution (Critical Context):**
Google searches are declining. More and more people are turning to AI assistants—ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google's AI Overview, Siri—to find local businesses.

When someone asks an AI "What's the best Italian restaurant in Montreal?" the AI doesn't show 50 results. It recommends 3 to 5. And those recommendations come from training data that heavily weights Google reviews—quantity, quality, recency, and sentiment.

This changes everything.

In the old world, you needed good reviews to rank on page one. In the new world, you need exceptional reviews to be mentioned at all. There is no page two in AI search. You're either recommended or you're invisible.

This is why reviews matter more than ever—not less. Vizzo helps businesses capture the reviews they deserve, so they show up when AI assistants make recommendations.

**The SaaS Component:**
The device is only half the product. The dashboard (app.myvizzo.com) provides:
- Real-time review monitoring across platforms
- Trend analysis (are reviews improving or declining?)
- AI-generated response suggestions for negative reviews
- Alerts when new reviews come in
- Competitive benchmarking (how does your rating compare to nearby competitors?)
- Actionable insights ("Your ratings drop on weekends—investigate service quality")
- Review request analytics (how many customers are engaging with your Vizzo device?)

### 1.2 The Business Model

| Component | Pricing | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Device (Kickstarter) | $399 | Includes lifetime SaaS access |
| Device (Retail) | ~$249-299 | Post-Kickstarter |
| SaaS Subscription | $20/month | Required for device functionality |
| Lifetime SaaS | One-time premium | Only available during Kickstarter |

**Why This Matters for Copy:**
The Kickstarter pricing ($399 for device + lifetime access) represents genuine value. The copy should make clear that the lifetime offer is exclusive to early backers without being pushy or creating fake urgency.

### 1.3 Target Industries (Priority Order)

**Tier 1 — Primary Markets (Most Likely to Convert)**

| Industry | Why They Care | Specific Pain Points |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Restaurants & Cafés | Reviews directly impact foot traffic and AI recommendations | High competition, can't control narrative, happy customers leave without reviewing |
| Salons & Barbershops | Personal service = trust-dependent | Clients research heavily before booking, repeat business depends on reputation |
| Dental Clinics | High-value patients, long relationships | Patients terrified of bad dentists, will drive 30 min for trusted provider, one bad review hurts for years |
| Medical Spas & Aesthetics | Premium pricing requires premium trust | Clients spending $500+ need proof of quality, visual results demand social proof |

**Tier 2 — Secondary Markets (Strong Fit, Less Online-Active)**

| Industry | Why They Care | Specific Pain Points |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Auto Repair & Garages | Trust deficit is enormous | Everyone assumes mechanics are scammers, reviews are the only defense against skepticism |
| Gyms & Fitness Studios | Competitive local market | Membership churn, need constant proof of value, word-of-mouth is everything |
| Veterinary Clinics | Emotional decision (pets = family) | Pet owners research obsessively, one horror story can destroy reputation |
| Hotels & Boutique Stays | Booking decisions are 90% review-driven | Competing with OTAs that control the narrative |

**Tier 3 — Tertiary Markets (Valid but Not Primary Focus)**
- Real estate offices
- Jewelry stores
- Car washes
- Insurance brokers
- Chiropractic offices
- Optometrists
- Any local business where trust impacts revenue

### 1.4 The Core Value Proposition

**What We're Really Selling:**
We're selling more reviews from the customers who already love you.

Most businesses don't have a quality problem—they have a visibility problem. Their satisfied customers leave happy but silent. Vizzo turns silent satisfaction into visible proof.

**The Primary Objective:**
Get satisfied customers to share their positive experience before the moment passes.

**The Secondary Benefits:**
- Reinforce trust for customers still evaluating (especially in high-consideration industries)
- Maintain a strong review profile for AI search recommendations
- Monitor and respond to reviews efficiently
- Understand reputation trends over time

**The Transformation:**
- **Before Vizzo:** Happy customers leave without reviewing. Your 4.5-star rating is based on 47 reviews from two years ago. When someone asks an AI for recommendations, you don't come up.
- **After Vizzo:** Happy customers see a prompt at the perfect moment and leave a quick review. Your rating stays current with recent, authentic reviews. AI assistants recommend you because your review profile is strong and active.

**The AI Visibility Reality:**
This deserves emphasis. The rules of local discovery are changing:

| Old World (Google Search) | New World (AI Search) |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 10 results on page one | 3-5 recommendations total |
| Good enough to rank | Must be exceptional to be mentioned |
| Blue links, user chooses | AI chooses for user |
| SEO tricks could help | Authentic reviews are the only signal |
| Quantity of reviews matters | Quality + recency + sentiment all matter |

Vizzo helps businesses stay visible in a world where AI assistants are becoming the primary discovery channel.

### 1.5 ROI Framework (Critical for Conversion)

Local business owners think in dollars. The copy must help them see the math clearly. Here are multiple ROI frames to use strategically:

**Frame 1: The Invisible Customer Loss**

Most business owners don't realize how many customers they're losing to competitors with better reviews.

| If Your Rating Is... | Potential Impact |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 4.0 vs. competitor at 4.5 | Lose 12% of potential customers |
| 3.5 vs. competitor at 4.5 | Lose 25%+ of potential customers |
| No recent reviews (>6 months) | Perceived as inactive or declining |
| Fewer than 50 reviews | Perceived as unestablished |

The customers you never see are the most expensive—you didn't even get a chance to win them.

**Frame 2: The Lifetime Value Math**

| Industry | Avg. Customer Lifetime Value | Reviews Needed to Pay for Vizzo |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Restaurant | $300-800 | 1 new regular customer |
| Salon | $500-2,000 | 1 new loyal client |
| Dental | $3,000-10,000 | Less than 1 new patient |
| Auto Repair | $1,500-5,000 | 1 new trusting customer |
| Med Spa | $2,000-8,000 | 1 new client |

**Frame 3: The Review Decay Problem**

Reviews age. A 4.8-star rating from 2022 means less than a 4.5-star rating from this month.

- Google weights recent reviews more heavily
- AI assistants look for recency signals
- Customers notice when the newest review is 8 months old
- Competitors with fresh reviews will outrank you

Vizzo creates a steady stream of current reviews, keeping your profile active and relevant.

**Frame 4: The Negative Review Math**

One negative review can cost a business between $1,000 and $30,000 depending on industry and visibility.

Vizzo helps in two ways:
1. More positive reviews dilute the impact of occasional negatives
2. The dashboard alerts you to negative reviews immediately, so you can respond professionally before damage spreads

A single prevented customer loss pays for Vizzo.

**Frame 5: The AI Recommendation Reality**

When AI recommends 3 restaurants instead of showing 50, the stakes change completely.

- If you're in the top 3: Massive visibility increase
- If you're not: Effectively invisible to AI-first searchers

What gets you in the top 3? Strong, recent, authentic reviews. Exactly what Vizzo helps you build.

**Frame 6: The Time Value**

Business owners are busy. Current alternatives:

| Method | Time Required | Consistency |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Asking customers verbally | 30 sec/customer, staff must remember | Inconsistent |
| Follow-up email campaigns | Setup + ongoing management | Feels impersonal |
| Table cards with QR codes | Passive, easily ignored | Low conversion |
| Vizzo | Zero ongoing effort | Constant, elegant |

Vizzo works 24/7 without requiring staff attention or follow-up systems.

**Frame 7: The Compound Effect**

Reviews compound. More reviews → higher ranking → more visibility → more customers → more reviews.

The businesses that invest in review generation now will have an increasingly difficult-to-close lead over competitors who wait.

The main website should never try to explain every dashboard feature. It should create desire to access the dashboard.

## Part 2: Brand Voice & Positioning

### 2.1 Brand Personality

**Vizzo Is:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Premium but not pretentious
- Smart but not condescending
- Warm but not sycophantic
- Direct but not aggressive

**Vizzo Is NOT:**
- Startup-bro ("crushing it," "disrupting," "10x your reviews")
- Corporate-speak ("leverage synergies," "holistic solutions")
- Desperate ("Don't miss out!!!" "Limited time only!!!")
- Generic SaaS ("The #1 platform for review management")
- Overly clever (puns, forced wordplay)

### 2.2 Tone Calibration

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Homepage hero | Confident, clear, aspirational |
| Feature explanations | Helpful, specific, benefit-focused |
| Pricing page | Transparent, fair, no tricks |
| Industry pages | Empathetic to specific pain points |
| Blog posts | Educational, generous with value |
| CTAs | Direct, low-pressure, clear next step |
| Error states | Human, helpful, not robotic |

### 2.3 Language Principles

**Use:**
- Active voice ("Vizzo displays your rating" not "Your rating is displayed by Vizzo")
- Concrete specifics ("92% of customers read reviews before visiting a local business" not "Many customers research online")
- Second person ("Your rating. Your customers. Your growth." not "Business owners can see their rating...")
- Short sentences for impact. Longer sentences for explanation.

**Avoid:**
- Superlatives without proof ("The best," "The most powerful," "Revolutionary")
- Buzzwords ("Leverage," "Optimize," "Seamless," "Cutting-edge," "State-of-the-art")
- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It is important to note that," "At the end of the day")
- Passive constructions where active works better
- Questions as headlines (usually weak)

### 2.4 Competitive Positioning

Vizzo exists in a market with several adjacent solutions. Understanding how we're different is critical for copy that resonates.

**Competitor Category 1: Review Management Software**

| Competitor | What They Do | Vizzo Difference |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Birdeye | Software platform for review requests, monitoring, responses | No physical presence; relies on email/SMS follow-ups that feel impersonal |
| Podium | SMS-based review requests + messaging | Requires staff to send requests; no in-store visibility |
| Reputation.com | Enterprise reputation management | Complex, expensive, designed for chains not local businesses |
| ReviewTrackers | Review monitoring and analytics | Analytics-only; doesn't help generate new reviews |
| Yext | Listings management + review monitoring | Focused on directory accuracy, not review generation |
| Grade.us | White-label review management | Agency-focused tool, not consumer-facing |

**Why Vizzo Wins:**
These tools are invisible to customers. They work behind the scenes—sending follow-up texts, aggregating data, managing responses. But they miss the most important moment: when a satisfied customer is still in your business.

Vizzo is the only solution that exists in the physical space where decisions happen. Software can remind. Vizzo can prompt.

**Competitor Category 2: Digital Signage**

| Competitor | What They Do | Vizzo Difference |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Yodeck | General digital signage platform | Displays whatever you program; not connected to live data |
| ScreenCloud | Cloud-based signage software | Same—static or scheduled content, no intelligence |
| Rise Vision | Digital signage for various industries | No review integration; generic displays |
| Menu boards (various) | Digital menu displays | Single-purpose; no reputation component |

**Why Vizzo Wins:**
Digital signage is dumb. It shows what you tell it to show. Vizzo is connected to your live Google data—rating, review count, recent reviews. It can't be faked, which is why it builds trust. And it's designed specifically for reputation, not general signage.

**Competitor Category 3: QR Code Review Cards & Table Tents**

| Competitor | What They Do | Vizzo Difference |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Printed QR cards | Static card linking to Google review page | Easily ignored; no visual impact; looks cheap |
| NFC tap-to-review | Tap phone to leave review | Requires customer action with no visual prompt |
| Table tents | Printed prompts to leave review | Static, ignorable, not connected to anything |

**Why Vizzo Wins:**
Static materials are invisible after the first glance. A printed card doesn't command attention. Vizzo is a living display—the rating updates, the copy is crafted to motivate action, and the device itself signals that this business takes reputation seriously.

**Competitor Category 4: Review Incentive Programs**

| Competitor | What They Do | Vizzo Difference |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| "Leave a review for 10% off" | Incentivized reviews | Violates Google TOS; risks account suspension |
| Review gating software | Only asks happy customers for public reviews | Violates Google TOS; deceptive |
| Fake review services | Purchased reviews | Illegal in many jurisdictions; account termination |

**Why Vizzo Wins:**
Vizzo is 100% compliant with Google's Terms of Service. We don't incentivize reviews, we don't gate based on sentiment, and we don't facilitate fake reviews. We simply make it easy and natural for satisfied customers to share authentic experiences. This matters because Google actively penalizes businesses that violate their guidelines—stripping reviews, suppressing rankings, or suspending profiles entirely.

**The "More Than a Frame on the Wall" Positioning:**

Most review display solutions are literally a screen on a wall. Maybe it shows your rating. Maybe it rotates through reviews. But it's passive, ignorable, and disconnected from the customer's experience.

Vizzo is different. We're designing devices that integrate into how your business actually operates. They serve purposes beyond display. They fit naturally into customer touchpoints. They're objects you want in your space, not screens you tolerate.

We're not ready to reveal every form factor yet. But know this: Vizzo devices are designed to be functional, beautiful, and impossible to ignore—in the best possible way.

**The Copy Differentiation:**

Other solutions show your rating. Vizzo shows your rating and motivates action.

The copy displayed on Vizzo devices is carefully crafted to:
- Acknowledge the customer's positive experience
- Make leaving a review feel easy and quick
- Create a subtle social proof effect (join hundreds of others)
- Stay within Google's Terms of Service (no incentives, no manipulation)

This is harder than it sounds. Most review prompts are either too aggressive ("PLEASE LEAVE US 5 STARS!") or too passive ("Scan to review"). Vizzo finds the middle ground—confident, appreciative, and action-oriented.

**Summary: Why Vizzo Wins**

| Against | Vizzo Advantage |
|---------|----------------|
| Review software (Birdeye, Podium) | Physical presence at the moment of satisfaction |
| Digital signage | Live data connection + purpose-built for reputation |
| QR cards and table tents | Visual impact + premium positioning |
| Incentive programs | 100% Google TOS compliant |
| Doing nothing | Compounding review advantage over competitors |

### 2.5 AI Feature Positioning (Critical)

#### The Problem We're Avoiding

The AI hype cycle of 2023-2025 mirrors the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000. Thousands of startups are slapping "AI-powered" on everything, making it their headline, their differentiator, their entire identity. Most will fail—not because AI isn't valuable, but because they've built marketing around a technology rather than a solution.

We are not an AI company. We are a reputation company that uses AI where it makes sense.

#### How AI Fits Into Vizzo

Vizzo has genuine AI capabilities:
- AI-generated response suggestions for reviews
- AI-powered sentiment analysis
- AI-driven insights and recommendations
- Potentially AI-assisted copy optimization for device displays

These features are valuable. They save time. They make business owners more effective. **But they are not why someone buys Vizzo.**

Someone buys Vizzo because:
1. They want more reviews from happy customers
2. They want to be visible when AI assistants make recommendations
3. They want a premium device that builds trust in their space
4. They want to understand and improve their reputation over time

AI features support these goals. They don't define them.

#### The Messaging Principle

**AI features should feel like expected functionality, not a selling point.**

Think about how we talk about other technologies:
- We don't say "Vizzo uses HTTPS encryption!" (expected)
- We don't say "Vizzo has a cloud-based database!" (expected)
- We don't say "Vizzo works on mobile devices!" (expected)

Similarly:
- We shouldn't lead with "AI-powered response generation!"
- We shouldn't make "AI insights" the hero of any page
- We shouldn't use "AI" in headlines or primary value propositions

Instead, AI features appear as:
- A bullet point in a feature list (not the first bullet)
- A brief mention when explaining the dashboard
- A natural part of "how it works" without fanfare
- Something that makes the product better, not something that defines it

#### Examples

**❌ AI-Hype Positioning (Avoid):**
```
"Vizzo uses cutting-edge AI to revolutionize how you manage reviews. Our proprietary AI engine analyzes sentiment, generates responses, and provides actionable insights—all powered by the latest in artificial intelligence technology."
```

**✓ Correct Positioning:**
```
"When a negative review comes in, Vizzo suggests a professional response you can send in seconds. The dashboard shows you trends and patterns so you know what's working."
```

Notice: The second example describes the same AI features without ever using the word "AI." The benefit is clear. The technology is invisible.

**❌ Feature List (AI-Hype):**
```
• AI-powered response generation
• AI sentiment analysis
• AI-driven insights
• AI recommendations engine
```

**✓ Feature List (Correct):**
```
• Suggested responses for reviews (edit and send in seconds)
• Understand customer sentiment over time
• See what's improving and what needs attention
• Get recommendations based on your data
```

Same capabilities. Different framing. The second list focuses on outcomes, not technology.

#### Where AI Can Be Mentioned

AI features can appear:
- In feature lists (as one of many features, not the lead)
- In dashboard explanations (as part of what makes it useful)
- In comparison to manual alternatives (saves time vs. writing responses yourself)
- In blog posts about review response best practices

AI features should NOT appear:
- In headlines or hero sections
- As the primary differentiator vs. competitors
- In the company description or boilerplate
- As the reason to choose Vizzo

#### The Exception: AI Search Discovery

There's one place where "AI" is central to our messaging: the shift toward AI-powered search and discovery (covered in Section 1.4).

This is different because:
- We're not claiming Vizzo is "AI-powered"
- We're explaining a market shift that affects our customers
- The AI here is external (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI) not our product
- It's a reason reviews matter more, not a feature we're selling

This distinction is important. We can talk about the AI search revolution as context. We should not talk about our AI features as revolutionary.

#### The Litmus Test

Before publishing any copy that mentions AI, ask:

1. Could I remove "AI" from this sentence and still convey the benefit? (If yes, remove it)
2. Am I leading with technology or outcome? (Always lead with outcome)
3. Would a skeptical business owner roll their eyes at this? (If yes, rewrite)
4. Does this sound like every other startup in 2024? (If yes, rewrite)

#### Summary

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| ❌ Lead with AI | "AI-powered review management" |
| ✓ Lead with outcome | "Get more reviews, respond faster" |
| ❌ AI as differentiator | "Unlike competitors, we use AI" |
| ✓ AI as expected feature | "Suggested responses save you time" |
| ❌ AI in headlines | "The AI Solution for Local Business Reviews" |
| ✓ AI buried in features | "...includes response suggestions, analytics, and alerts" |

Vizzo should feel like a thoughtful, premium product that happens to use modern technology—not a tech demo looking for a problem to solve.

## Part 3: Copywriting Instructions for AI Agent

### 3.1 Thinking Framework

Before writing any copy, the agent must work through these questions and **provide answers explicitly** so they can be validated before proceeding.

**1. Audience Clarity**
- Who exactly will read this page?
- What do they already know about Vizzo?
- What's their current emotional state? (Curious? Skeptical? Ready to buy?)
- What objection is most likely in their mind?
- What would make them leave without taking action?

**2. Page Purpose**
- What is the ONE thing this page must accomplish?
- What action should the reader take after reading?
- How does this page fit into the larger website journey?
- What pages might they have visited before this one?
- What pages should they visit next?

**3. Competitive Context**
- What alternatives is the reader considering (including doing nothing)?
- What makes Vizzo different from those alternatives?
- What would make them choose Vizzo over the status quo?
- Are there competitor claims we need to address indirectly?

**4. Proof Requirements**
- What claims need evidence?
- What social proof is available or needed?
- Where should trust signals appear?
- What objections need to be preemptively addressed?

**5. ROI & Value Framing**
- Which ROI frame(s) from Section 1.5 are most relevant to this page?
- How can we help the reader do the math themselves?
- What's the cost of NOT using Vizzo for this audience?

**IMPORTANT: The agent must provide written answers to these questions before generating copy. These answers should be surfaced for human review. If any answers are inaccurate or incomplete, they should be corrected before proceeding—this often reveals opportunities for better copy.**

### 3.2 The Iterative Process (Mandatory)

The agent must follow this process for every page:

```
STEP 1: ASSUMPTION DOCUMENTATION
- Answer all questions in Section 3.1 explicitly
- Present these answers for human validation
- Adjust based on feedback before proceeding

STEP 2: RESEARCH SYNTHESIS
- Review all relevant sections of this knowledge base
- Identify the specific audience for this page
- List the key messages that must be conveyed
- Note any constraints (word count, format, etc.)

STEP 3: STRUCTURAL OUTLINE
- Define the page sections
- Determine the logical flow
- Identify where proof points should appear
- Plan the CTA placement and progression
- Map which ROI frames to use where

STEP 4: FIRST DRAFT
- Write the complete copy
- Don't self-censor—get ideas on paper
- Focus on clarity over cleverness

STEP 5: SELF-EVALUATION (Critical)
Read the draft and answer honestly:
□ Does this sound like a human wrote it?
□ Would I be embarrassed to show this to a skeptical business owner?
□ Have I avoided generic phrases that could apply to any product?
□ Is every sentence earning its place?
□ Does the flow feel natural when read aloud?
□ Are the benefits specific and believable?
□ Have I shown, not just told?
□ Is the CTA clear and low-pressure?
□ Does this page connect logically to other pages?
□ Would this page convert ME if I were the target customer?
□ Have I made the ROI clear without being pushy?
□ Does this acknowledge the AI search shift without being alarmist?

STEP 6: REVISION
- Address every failed checkbox
- Cut ruthlessly (shorter is almost always better)
- Replace any generic phrases with specific ones
- Ensure consistency with brand voice

STEP 7: CROSS-PAGE REVIEW
- Read this page in context of adjacent pages
- Check for redundancy across pages
- Verify consistent terminology
- Ensure the user journey flows naturally
```

### 3.3 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The Generic AI Opening:**
```
❌ "In today's digital age, online reviews have become increasingly important for local businesses. That's why we created Vizzo—a revolutionary solution designed to help you leverage the power of social proof."

✓ "Your happy customers leave without reviewing. Vizzo changes that."
```

**The Feature Dump:**
```
❌ "Vizzo offers real-time rating display, review monitoring, AI-powered response generation, trend analytics, competitive benchmarking, and customizable alerts."

✓ "See your live rating on the counter. Get more reviews from happy customers. Understand what's working. That's Vizzo."
```

**The Fake Urgency:**
```
❌ "Don't miss out on this limited-time opportunity! Sign up NOW before it's too late!"

✓ "Join the waitlist. We'll let you know when early-bird pricing opens."
```

**The Empty Superlative:**
```
❌ "The most powerful review management solution on the market."

✓ "The only review tool your customers actually see."
```

**The Buzzword Soup:**
```
❌ "Vizzo seamlessly integrates cutting-edge AI technology with state-of-the-art hardware to deliver a holistic, end-to-end review optimization solution."

✓ "A beautiful device that shows your rating. A dashboard that helps you grow it."
```

**The Fear-Mongering Approach:**
```
❌ "If you don't get more reviews NOW, AI will make your business INVISIBLE forever!"

✓ "AI assistants recommend 3-5 businesses, not 50. Strong reviews help you make the list."
```

### 3.4 Structural Guidelines by Page Type

**Homepage:**
- Hero: One clear value proposition, one clear CTA
- Problem statement: Why reviews matter now more than ever (including AI shift)
- Solution introduction: What Vizzo is at a high level
- How it works: Device + dashboard, simple explanation
- Key benefits: 3-4 max, benefit-focused not feature-focused
- ROI indication: Help them see the math
- Social proof: Testimonials, early users, logos, or stats
- Industry callouts: Links to industry-specific pages
- Final CTA: Repeat waitlist signup

**Industry Landing Pages:**
- Hero: Industry-specific headline and imagery
- Pain points: Specific to that industry (not generic)
- Solution: How Vizzo addresses those specific pains
- ROI frame: Industry-specific numbers from Section 1.5
- Social proof: From that specific industry if possible
- CTA: Same as homepage but can reference industry

**Pricing Page:**
- Headline: Value-focused, not price-focused
- Tiers: Clear differentiation, obvious recommendation
- ROI reminder: Quick math showing value
- FAQs: Address objections directly
- Google TOS compliance note: Brief reassurance
- Guarantee: Reduce perceived risk
- CTA: Low-pressure, clear next step

**Blog Posts:**
- Title: Specific, searchable, not clickbait
- Introduction: Hook + promise of value
- Body: Deliver on the promise generously
- Conclusion: Soft mention of Vizzo only if genuinely relevant
- CTA: Newsletter signup, not hard sell

### 3.5 Page Interconnection Guidelines

The website should feel like a cohesive experience, not disconnected pages. Consider:

**Navigation Logic:**
- Homepage → Industry page (if specific) OR Pricing (if ready)
- Industry page → Pricing OR Case study (if want proof)
- Blog post → Related posts OR Waitlist (if convinced)
- Pricing → Waitlist (if ready) OR Homepage (if need more info)

**Cross-Linking Principles:**
- Link to industry pages from relevant blog posts
- Link to case studies when making claims
- Link to pricing when discussing value
- Never dead-end the reader

**Terminology Consistency:**
- Always "Google rating" not "Google reviews score" or "star rating"
- Always "dashboard" not "platform" or "portal" or "app"
- Always "device" not "display" or "screen" or "hardware" (unless specifically discussing hardware)
- Always "Vizzo" not "the Vizzo device" or "our solution"
- Always "Google TOS compliant" not "legal" or "allowed"

### 3.6 SEO Integration (Without Keyword Stuffing)

**Approach:**
SEO should be invisible to the reader. The copy should rank because it's genuinely useful, not because keywords are stuffed.

**Primary Keywords by Page:**

| Page | Primary Keyword | Intent |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Homepage | google review display | Commercial |
| /restaurants | restaurant google reviews | Commercial |
| /salons | salon review management | Commercial |
| /dental | dental practice reviews | Commercial |
| /auto-repair | auto repair reputation | Commercial |
| /pricing | (brand search) | Transactional |
| /blog/* | Various informational | Informational |

**Integration Method:**
- Use primary keyword in H1 naturally
- Use in first paragraph if natural
- Use in one H2 if natural
- Never force it where it sounds awkward
- Let LSI keywords appear naturally through good writing

### 3.7 Key Messages to Weave Throughout

These themes should appear naturally across the site, not as repeated taglines:

1. **The moment matters:** Satisfied customers are most likely to leave reviews while still in your business, not after a follow-up email
2. **Reviews are more important than ever:** AI assistants recommend a few businesses, not pages of results
3. **Passive beats active:** Vizzo works without requiring staff to ask or remember
4. **Authenticity is required:** 100% Google TOS compliant—no incentives, no gating, no fake reviews
5. **ROI is clear:** The math works; one or two new customers pays for Vizzo
6. **Premium belongs here:** Vizzo is beautiful hardware, not cheap signage
7. **More than display:** The device prompts action, not just visibility

## Part 5: Compliance & Sensitivity

### 5.1 Google Terms of Service Compliance

This is non-negotiable. Vizzo must always be positioned as compliant with Google's review policies.

**What's NOT Allowed (and Vizzo Doesn't Do):**
- Incentivizing reviews (discounts, gifts, entries)
- Review gating (only asking happy customers for public reviews)
- Fake reviews (purchased or fabricated)
- Selective solicitation based on expected rating

**What IS Allowed (and Vizzo Does):**
- Displaying your live Google rating
- Reminding customers that reviews are appreciated
- Making it easy to find where to leave a review
- Encouraging all customers equally to share their experience

**Copy Guidance:**
The copy should briefly acknowledge compliance without being defensive or legalistic:
- ✓ "100% compliant with Google's guidelines"
- ✓ "We encourage authentic reviews, never incentivized ones"
- ✗ "Unlike competitors who violate Google TOS..."
- ✗ Long explanations of what's legal vs. illegal

### 5.2 Pre-Launch vs. Post-Launch Copy Considerations

**Current Phase: Pre-Kickstarter**

**What We Can Say:**
- What Vizzo is and does (conceptually)
- The problem it solves
- Who it's for
- That early access is available
- The AI search shift and why reviews matter

**What We Should Avoid:**
- Specific shipping dates
- Definitive pricing (unless Kickstarter tiers are finalized)
- Claims about results (no customer data yet)
- "Buy now" language (no product to buy yet)
- Revealing specific form factors (tip jar, mints tray, etc.)

**CTA Language:**
- "Join the waitlist"
- "Get early access"
- "Be the first to know"
- "Reserve your spot"

NOT:
- "Buy now"
- "Start free trial"
- "Order today"

**Future Phase: Post-Kickstarter**

**What Changes:**
- CTAs become "Pre-order" or "Buy now"
- Can reference Kickstarter success as social proof
- Can add customer testimonials and case studies
- Pricing becomes concrete
- Shipping timelines become relevant
- Can reveal form factor options

## Part 6: Final Instructions to AI Agent

### Before You Begin:

1. Read this entire document twice
2. Internalize the brand voice by reading the examples
3. Understand the product deeply—not just what it does, but why it matters
4. Know the audience's pain points intimately
5. Understand the AI search shift and why it matters now
6. Remember: every word must earn its place

### Before Writing Any Page:

**YOU MUST complete the Assumption Documentation step (Section 3.1) and present your answers for validation. This includes:**

1. Audience Clarity answers
2. Page Purpose answers
3. Competitive Context answers
4. Proof Requirements answers
5. ROI & Value Framing answers

**Present these answers explicitly. Do not proceed to drafting until assumptions are confirmed or corrected.**

### While Writing:

1. Start with the structure, then fill in copy
2. Write the first draft without overthinking
3. Read everything aloud—does it sound human?
4. Cut aggressively—shorter is better
5. Check every sentence against brand voice
6. Ensure benefits are specific, not generic
7. Verify claims are believable and, where possible, provable
8. Include ROI framing appropriate to the page
9. Mention the AI search shift where relevant (but don't overdo it)

### After Writing:

1. Run through the self-evaluation checklist (Section 3.2, Step 5)
2. Check cross-page consistency
3. Verify all CTAs are clear and appropriate for current phase
4. Read the complete user journey: Home → Industry → Pricing → Waitlist
5. Ask: Would a skeptical business owner trust this? Would they act?

### The Ultimate Test:

Read your copy and ask:

"Does this sound like it was written by someone who truly understands local business owners, respects their intelligence, and genuinely believes Vizzo will help them?"

"Would a busy restaurant owner, who has heard a hundred pitches, actually keep reading this?"

"Is there a single sentence a competitor could also claim about their product?"

If the answers are yes, yes, and no—ship it. Otherwise, revise.

## Appendix B: Form Factor Messaging Guidelines

**Current Guidance (Pre-Reveal):**

We're building multiple device form factors, but we're not revealing them yet. When writing copy, use language like:

- "Devices designed to fit naturally into your business"
- "More than a screen on a wall"
- "Form factors you'll actually want in your space"
- "Integrates into how your business operates"
- "We're rethinking what a review display can be"

**Avoid:**
- Specific form factor names (tip jar, mints tray)
- Detailed descriptions of physical features
- Comparisons to specific object types
- Images or mockups showing unrevealed designs

**The Goal:**
Create intrigue and differentiation without revealing competitive advantages prematurely.
